## Technical Report

### Building blocks of the project

The whole project processing happened in 3 main phases.

**Phase 1**: We started with looking for publicly available data that best suits our
needs. We examined many datasets and chosed the one that had not been
already processed or cleaned.

**Phase 2**: Designing Backbone of the application.
 At this stage of the project we decided to design a timeseries
 forcasting web application with processed data and trained model based on the processed data.

 Frontend desicions: TypeScript, React used in coding the client part of the application.
 Backend desicions: A basic server app with flask framework that servers incoming
 requests from the client.

 **Phase 3**: Iterating development process.
 At this stage we started processing data and developing both client and server apps
 in an iterating way. Data processing was an essential part of the development process
 all the time. 


#### Challenges and improvements
During the project timeline we faced many challenges. Technical, theoretical,
deadline and other kinds of challenges that are typical in group projects.There were some
workload imbalance between team members. 

The idea-establishment was one of the most time-consuming issue. At the first, the initial idea
suposed to be clear and practical but later we realized that we cannot get out of it too much
usefule information so we had to try another ideas.

The most important thing is that we didn't give up and fortunately we managed to
get something useful as outcome.
